Lamassu is an IoT first PKI designed for industrial scenarios. This is the main code repository for Lamassu IoT where the product logic is being implemented. If you are looking for deployment instructions, please check the [docs](https://www.lamassu.io/docs/) or the project's [Docker Compose repository](https://github.com/lamassuiot/lamassu-compose).

## Running Unit tests

Each service has its own set of unit tests. To run them, you can use the following commands:
 > **Note:** In order to speed up the process, the tests are run in parallel by default.
 
#For pretty printing
go install github.com/haveyoudebuggedit/gotestfmt/v2/cmd/gotestfmt@v2.3.1

go test -json -v ./pkg/ca/server/api/ | gotestfmt
go test -json -v ./pkg/dms-manager/server/api/ | gotestfmt
go test -json -v ./pkg/device-manager/server/api/ | gotestfmt
go test -json -v ./pkg/alerts/server/api/ | gotestfmt
go test -json -v ./pkg/ocsp/server/api/ | gotestfmt
```

Or run all tests with:

```bash
go test ./pkg/...
```

Also, it is also posible to run all the test at once and obtain the overall coverage:

```bash	
go test -json -v ./pkg/... -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./...
go tool cover -func coverage.out | grep total
```
